        \projectHeadingWithoutLink{SpeechToCode}{Python, ReactJS, Node.js}
            \begin{justify}
                   \vspace{-0.15cm} Built a meta language parser that enables you to speak in a language close to English and creates a class based abstraction based on it, which is then easily translated to the language selected. Worked on designing the frontend and connecting the parser to the frontend using a flask server. \par
            \end{justify}

        \projectHeadingWithoutLink{DeusCL}{Rust, Common Lisp, Yew Framework}
            \begin{justify}
                   \vspace{-0.15cm} A memory-safe REPL built in Rust. Built a handwritten recursive descent parser and a visitor pattern dependent evaluator. Added a basic type inference, type checking and error handling system. Added dynamic evaluation of functional environment and parameters. Wrote a simple garbage collector and environment cleaner. Building a frontend in Yew Framework in Rust to enable users to use a web based simulation of REPL.\par
            \end{justify}

        \projectHeadingWithoutLink{Publixmon}{MongoDB, Express.JS, React Native, Node.JS, Flask, Node.js }
            \begin{justify}
                  \vspace{-0.15cm} Publixmon is an app to boost retail engagement. Built a smart contract allowing users to mint NFTs based on Order History of each user. Integrated with the NCR BSP layer to pull order details, catalog and inventory details. Built and tested mining NFTs on the Ganache Blockchain and built a node.js server to facilitate blockchain actions.   Project Won the First Place at the NCR API Challenge at HackGT 8. \par
            \end{justify}

        \projectHeadingWithoutLink{Mental Health Chat}{Redis, Docker, MongoDB, Express.JS, ReactJS, Node.JS, Socket.IO}
            \begin{justify}
                \vspace{-0.15cm} A timed chat for people to share and talk about issues their having in relation with their mental health and help them overcome it. A message in the Redis database is set to expire in about 6 hours in order to encourage people to come out and discourage users calling each other out. Created a Dockerized App with a Redis Instance during development. \par
            \end{justify}

            \begin{justify}
                    \vspace{-0.15cm} Worked with a team of 3 for the "hack-a-lang" event, to make the python implementation of the Lox Learning Language, complete with an implementation of dynamic functional environments, type checking, error handling, recursive descent parser and a visitor patter dependent evaluator. Also, spoke at the event about the evaluator, visitor patterns, environment creation and variable handing. Also, created exercise for the participants to work on to increase their knowledge. \par
